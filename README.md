# ParkWorks-Vermont
A resource hub for Vermont municipalities and park &amp; recreation organizations to plan, design, fund, and sustain community parks.

## Project Overview

The UVM ParkWorks initiative aims to create a centralized, accessible resource to support Vermont municipalities in planning, improving, and managing public parks. This platform will integrate GIS-based mapping tools, planning guidelines, and professional engagement strategies to streamline park development and enhancement processes.

## Objectives
- Provide Comprehensive Park Data: Aggregate and display municipal park information through interactive web maps and spreadsheets, leveraging existing resources such as ArcGIS Online and Vermont ANR GIS datasets.
- Facilitate Community and Professional Collaboration: Define clear stages for community input, outreach, and engagement with professional partners (e.g., landscape architects, contractors). Outline expectations for municipalities and when to involve experts.
- Offer Planning and Design Resources: Include examples of successful park planning projects, StoryMaps, and grant impact reports to inspire and guide municipalities.
