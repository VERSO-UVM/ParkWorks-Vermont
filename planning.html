                    <li><strong>Community Assessment:</strong> Survey residents to understand demographics, needs, and preferences for park amenities and programming</li>
                    <li><strong>Site Analysis:</strong> Evaluate potential locations considering accessibility, environmental factors, and existing infrastructure</li>
                    <li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement:</strong> Involve town officials, residents, local organizations, and neighboring landowners in the planning process</li>
                    <li><strong>Vision Development:</strong> Create a shared vision that reflects community values and long-term goals</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="content-section">
                <h3>Key Planning Steps</h3>

                    <li><strong>Inventory Existing Parks:</strong> Document current park facilities, usage patterns, and maintenance needs</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Gaps and Opportunities:</strong> Determine what types of facilities and programs are lacking in your community</li>
                    <li><strong>Set Priorities:</strong> Rank projects based on community need, feasibility, and available resources</li>
                    <li><strong>Develop a Master Plan:</strong> Create a comprehensive document that guides park development over 5-10 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Establish Implementation Timeline:</strong> Break the master plan into phases with realistic timeframes and milestones</li>
