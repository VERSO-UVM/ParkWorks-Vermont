  <h1>Planning Your Park: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>
  <p>Creating a park is more than just setting aside land—it’s about building a space that reflects your community’s values and needs. This stage focuses on turning ideas into actionable plans, ensuring your project is well-informed and sustainable.</p>

  <article>
    <h2>Define Your Vision</h2>
    <p>Every successful park begins with a clear vision. Ask yourself: What role will this park play in the community? Is it a place for recreation, conservation, or social gathering? Understanding your purpose will guide every decision moving forward.</p>
    <p>Engage stakeholders early—town managers, residents, and local organizations—to shape a vision that resonates with everyone. Consider drafting a short vision statement and sharing it publicly to build excitement and transparency.</p>

  <article>
    <h2>Understand Community Needs</h2>
    <p>A park should serve the people who use it. Conduct surveys, host listening sessions, and review existing amenities to identify gaps. For example, does your town need more playgrounds for families, or trails for hikers? Gathering this input ensures your design reflects real needs, not assumptions.</p>
    <p>Tip: Use online tools or printed questionnaires to reach a broad audience. Document feedback and prioritize features based on demand and feasibility.</p>

    <h2>Choose the Right Site</h2>
    <p>Location matters. Evaluate potential sites for accessibility, environmental impact, and proximity to neighborhoods. Consider ADA compliance, parking availability, and how the site fits into the town’s long-term development plans.</p>
    <p>Before committing, conduct a feasibility study. This might include soil tests, drainage analysis, and environmental assessments to avoid costly surprises later.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Develop a Concept Design</h2>
    <p>Once you have a site and a vision, start sketching ideas. Your concept design should include key features like trails, playgrounds, sports fields, and gathering spaces. Think about flow—how people will move through the park—and safety considerations.</p>
    <p>Free tools like SketchUp or QGIS can help you create visual layouts. Sharing these early drafts with the community can spark feedback and enthusiasm.</p>

    <h2>Build a Budget and Timeline</h2>
    <p>Budgeting is critical. Estimate costs for construction, landscaping, equipment, and ongoing maintenance. Break the project into phases if funding is limited—start with essential features and expand over time.</p>
    <p>Create a realistic timeline that accounts for permitting, fundraising, and seasonal constraints. A clear financial plan will make grant applications and fundraising efforts more successful.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>Engage the Community</h2>
    <p>Parks thrive when communities feel ownership. Host public meetings, share design updates, and invite volunteers to participate in planning. Transparency builds trust and can even attract local sponsorships or donations.</p>
    <p>Consider creating a project page or social media presence to keep residents informed and involved throughout the process.</p>
