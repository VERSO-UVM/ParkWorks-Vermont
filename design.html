                  <h1>Design Stage: Bringing Your Vision to Life</h1>
                  <p>Once your planning is complete, it’s time to transform ideas into detailed designs. This stage focuses on creating functional, beautiful spaces that meet community needs while respecting environmental and budget constraints.</p>
                  <h2>Start with a Master Plan</h2>
                  <p>A master plan is the blueprint for your park. It should outline the overall layout, key features, and future expansion possibilities. Think of it as a roadmap that guides construction and long-term maintenance. Include zones for different activities—playgrounds, sports fields, trails, and quiet areas. Consider how these spaces connect and flow to create a welcoming experience for all visitors.</p>

                  <h2>Prioritize Accessibility and Safety</h2>
                  <p>Design for everyone. Ensure paths, restrooms, and play areas meet ADA standards. Safety should be integrated into every decision—clear sightlines, proper lighting, and durable materials reduce risks and improve usability.</p>
                  <p>Tip: Use contrasting colors for edges and ramps, and include signage that is easy to read for all ages.</p>

                  <h2>Choose Sustainable Materials</h2>
                  <p>Sustainability isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a necessity. Opt for recycled or locally sourced materials where possible. Native plants reduce water usage and maintenance costs while supporting local ecosystems.</p>
                  <p>Consider permeable surfaces for parking and paths to manage stormwater naturally.</p>

                  <h2>Integrate Natural Features</h2>
                  <p>Work with the land, not against it. Preserve existing trees, wetlands, and slopes when possible. Natural features add beauty and reduce construction costs while promoting biodiversity.</p>
                  <p>Tip: Use natural shade from trees to reduce the need for built structures like pavilions.</p>

                  <h2>Plan for Maintenance</h2>
                  <p>A great design considers the future. Choose plants and materials that are easy to maintain. Include storage areas for equipment and design spaces that can be easily cleaned and repaired.</p>
                  <p>Long-term sustainability depends on reducing upkeep costs without sacrificing quality.</p>
              
                  <h2>Visualize and Share</h2>
                  <p>Bring your design to life with renderings or 3D models. These visuals help stakeholders and the community understand the project and provide feedback before construction begins.</p>
                  <p>Free tools like SketchUp or Canva can help create compelling presentations for grant applications and public meetings.</p>
